Run Mopt tests


select one of the folder under Mopt_tests/, for example: Mopt_tests/i7_yolo/
compile:
icpc -Ofast -O3 -axAVX,CORE-AVX2 -mavx2 -qopenmp -march=native --std=c++11 TEST_TO_RUN.cc
run:
./a.out



-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Run Intel oneDNN tests
1. dnnl_tmp.cpp is the main entry of executing oneDNN 

2. Modify oneDNN library path in both compile.sh and execute.sh

3. Run compile.sh to compile code and then run execute.sh to measure performance.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Run TVM tests
1. Using TVM v0.6 commit 008aa838139bcd8e66c680f14a944f7af274a33d
and LLVM-8

2. Build TVM following its official website instruction

3. Replace tvm/topi/python/topi/x86/conv2d.py with the the file we provide(same file name). We create a new TOPI registered function to invoke convolution schedule and template.

4. Execute auto-tuning script (tune_conv2d_x86.py);
The tuning script select the best configuration tuned from tvm and dump it as llvm source file.

5. Modify dumped llvm file to invoke cache flush and timing
a)Insert "call void @get_time(i32 1)" in around line 55 (after the entry label of tvm convolution function call "fconv")
b)Insert "call void @get_time(i32 0)" before tvm fconv function retunr in around line 523. 
c)Register "declare void @get_time(i32)" in the llvm file.

6. Build llvm file and generate shared object (.so) file
by using command "clang-8 -shared -fPIC -mavx2 -march=native -O3 Vi0.log.ll -o Vi0.so timing.c -fopenmp=libomp "
replace llvm file name and output file name. See generate_so.script.
 
7. Measure performance throughput of tvm code by runing tune_conv2d_x86_timing.py. Time will be printout on terminal, so redirect it to a file to use it later.


Note:
1) For tuning and timing script you need to change the TVM_NUM_THREADS based on the target machine. see line 14-15 in both tuning and timing python script. Also for flush cache for multi core, you need change "num_of_core" in timing.c line 10.
2) The bash script is provided. Check the input arguments based on bash script.(tune-*.script and tune-*_timing.script)
3) tune_conv2d_x86_timing.py needs load so file we generated from step 6. Please go to line 76 to modify the path.
4) Source files and scripts for experiments in paper locate in detail folder.
